            In June 2019, Ravshan Irmatov was appointed as the first
            Vice-President of the Uzbekistan Football Association. The first
            Vice-President of this organization is the de facto leader of
            Uzbekistan’s football. He began reforms in Uzbekistani football
            after long criticism and corruption scandals in this country's
            football. Due to a new job, announced a temporary break in the
            career of the referee. During the inauguration, he said, “If we all
            come together and work for the same goal, we will overcome any
            difficulties”.[2]

          <blockquote>
            Tashkent is the capital city of Uzbekistan. It’s known for its many
            museums and its mix of modern and Soviet-era architecture. The Amir
            Timur Museum houses manuscripts, weapons and other relics from the
            Timurid dynasty. Nearby, the huge State Museum of History of
            Uzbekistan has centuries-old Buddhist artifacts. The city’s skyline
            is distinguished by Tashkent Tower, which offers city views from its
            observation deck.

            <em>Irmatov's father</em> was also a referee, working in Soviet
            competitions. He has been a full international referee for
            <strong>FIFA</strong> since 2003. He is considered one of the elite
            referees in the world.[3]

              >He was selected as a referee for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup</a
            >
            in Canada, where he refereed the group stage match between Gambia
            and Mexico, as well as the match between Chile and Congo. He was
            never formally accused of bribery, but along the Bakhadyr Kochkarov
            line, they are among the judges appointed by FIFA to carry out the
            arrangement of several matches, commanded by Joseph Blatter, who
            finally, along with several of his collaborators, were tried by a
            huge list of criminal acts linked to corruption at the highest
            level.
